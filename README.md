Blackjack for day 11 of 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu.
For "infinite" deck as per instructions, set n_of_decks to 0.
Deck is dynamic meaning it loses cards (as long as n_of_decks > 0) as you continue to play. 
If there are insufficient cards on draw, reshuffle (repopulate deck by creating same number of decks).
